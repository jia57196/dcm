##DCM: Distributed Cache Management

This cache library is created to solve the interprocess problem caused by slow IO in data-centric system.
The idea is not well advanced comparing to sort of P2P techonology, especially to de-centralized distributed system, however, 
on the demands of Lower latency, this libray is faster and efficient to communicate among parties in concurrent situation.

This DCM is invented with the help of [boost](www.boost.org) library boost::interprocess

All code is c++ code with unit testing cases.
